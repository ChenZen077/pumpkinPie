          deliously spiced pumpkin filling. Hope you enjoy it as much as my family does! </p>

               mixture resembles coarse crumbs. mix 3 tablespoon water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to
               hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
          <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Rool dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness
               of 1/8 inches larger. Plac a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle
               of dough 1 1⁄2 inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discatd dough scraps and set pie pan aside.
          </li>

          pumpkin into chunks. Measure out 1 1⁄2 pounds for this recipe to yield 2 cups of mashed, cooked pumpkin. If
          your pumpkinis larger, consider cooking 3 pounds and doubling the pie recipe above to make two pies.</p>

          cove, and simmer until tenter, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool. Remove and discard peel. Return pumpkinto
